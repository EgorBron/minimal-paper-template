# Minimal Paper plugin Template

This is a very minimal template for a Paper plugin with Kotlin as a language and Gradle as a build tool.

1. download this repository, or clone it, or use as template
2. delete the `.git` dir and `README.md` file
3. edit `val`s on top of `build.gradle.kts` and refactor project package
    - optional: uncomment `implementation`s in `dependencies` block
4. sync the Gradle project in IDEA or wherever you like
5. start writing your plugin!

This template is in the public domain. Feel free to use it!
